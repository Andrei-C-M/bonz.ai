I (eventually) got to test the website in Lighthouse, and everything seems ok, except for a few minor issues that i had trouble understanding how to fix. This is probably the 5th version of the website, i was unhappy with how the others turned out, so I just started over. Still not happy with how the website "fells". I came up with a lot of crazy designs in Figma, but when i get to the coding part, i have trouble transforming the concept into a working product. I seem to suck at CSS. Everything goes well when i only have a few lines of code, but once the project grows, I have trouble figuring out what i did, where and why. So sorry if my code is messy.
